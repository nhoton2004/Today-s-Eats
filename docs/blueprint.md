## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant orange (#FF7849) to reflect Vietnamese cuisine's bright, flavorful essence.
- Background color: Pale orange (#FFF2EE), for a warm, inviting feel, not far from the primary hue.
- Accent color: Soft red (#E64949) for action items, since it's analogous to orange and contrasts well.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif font for a modern look with warmth.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for any code-like text or instructions.
- Use 'lucide-react' icons for a consistent and clean UI.
- Subtle fade-in animations and transitions for a smooth user experience.
